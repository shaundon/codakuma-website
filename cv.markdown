## About

I'm an experienced front-end and iOS developer who's looking for new challenges after a four-year stint as an engineering manager. My time in management gave me loads of experience with leading teams, having difficult conversations, and finding pragmatic solutions to tricky, ambiguous problems, and I'm excited to continue honing these skills as an indivudual contributor.

Outside of work I make [iOS apps](/), practising what I preach with best-in-class, accessible products that delight users. It's helped me develop a range of additional skills that make me more effective in my day job, like marketing, design, customer support, and business development.

I'm comfortable weating many hats and contributing to the business wherever I can have a positive impact, no matter where that is in the stack. At your company I'll advocate for simple solutions, biasing for action, and empowering engineers to grow and become more autonomous.

## Experience

### üì±&nbsp;Indie iOS Developer

<div class="cv-date">
    April 2020 - Present
</div>

In my spare time outside of work I'm an indie iOS developer. I've organically grown my workout tracking app [Personal Best](https://getpersonalbest.com) to 30,000 monthly active users and over 100,000 total downloads.

It‚Äôs been featured by Apple on the App Store, as well as in [iMore](https://www.imore.com/fitness-companion-personal-best-now-lets-you-share-your-workouts-glorious-technicolor), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today/) and [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/27/ios-14-widget-apps/), amongst other places.

In 2022 I released [Taylor's Version](http://taylorsversion.app), a passion project aimed at fans of Taylor Swift.

Alongside developing my apps I also blog about app development at [codakuma.com](https://codakuma.com).

I'm currently getting up to speed leading a small team who are building NewDay's loan offerings, a new product to be offered to existing customers.

</div>

Initially I was the engineering manager for the UX Products team, building and maintaining all visual aspects of Duffel, like the [duffel.com](https://duffel.com) website, the [dashboard](https://app.duffel.com/join) for merchants, as well as a [component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duffel/components) that allows merchants to build best-in-class experiences with minimal effort.

Under my leadership the front-end team successfully doubled in size, delivering lots of new products and improvements to existing ones. I also identified several areas of growing technical debt and helped to instill a culture of constantly addressing and reducing it.

As part of the engineering leadership team I also drove lots of other initiatives, like our levelling and career progression frameworks.

In October 2022 I decided to move out of management, and switched to leading engineers in an informal capacity, leading from the front by building [Duffel Links](https://duffel.com/links), a brand-new white label product, which was delivered in record time.

</div>

Team lead for [Backpack](https://backpack.github.io), Skyscanner's design system. My time was roughly 50% hands-on coding and the other half on people management and strategy.

I was heavily involved in [Skyscanner's 2019 rebrand](https://medium.com/@SkyscannerEng/how-we-scaled-our-design-system-to-unleash-skyscanners-new-brand-845a1f501b0b), a challenging year-long project affecting dozens of teams across the company. I also drove mobile support in the design system, quadrupling the number of platforms we supported while maintaining a lean, focused team.

As a manager, I mentored many of my direct report's through Skyscanner's promotion process, even helping one of them grow from an intern into a senior engineer.

I drove several initiatives outside of my usual scope, like rewriting and maintaining Skyscanner's front-end recruitment test, simplifying the engineering promotion process, as well as championing and running most aspects of Skyscanner's [talent directory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skyscanner_skyscanner-talent-directory-activity-6698944542705496064-5gRn).

I worked on a range of projects across Ensighten‚Äôs product line. My most notable work was developing Ensighten‚Äôs design system, which honed their disparate, confusing UIs into a single coherent experience that felt like one family of products.

This was my first job after university, where I was able to try my hand at many different technologies across ICUK‚Äôs entire stack, before deciding to specialise on front-end for my subsequent roles.
