## About

I'm a front-end developer turned engineering manager ready for new challenges. I advocate for simple, boring solutions that provide value to end users quickly and often, with best-in-class accessibility and usage of platform standards.

I'm looking for partially-remote roles in London (~2 days in the office, the rest working from home) as either a front-end developer, engineering manager or SwiftUI developer.

## Experience

### üõ© &nbsp;[Duffel](https://duffel.com)

<div class="cv-role">
    Engineering Manager
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    July 2021 ‚Äì Present
</div>

I'm the engineering manager for the UX Products team. We build and maintain most visual aspects of Duffel, like the [duffel.com](https://duffel.com) website, the [dashboard](https://app.duffel.com) for merchants, as well as a [component library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duffel/components) that allows merchants to build best-in-class experiences with minimal effort.

As part of the engineering leadership team I also drive lots of other initiatives, like our levelling framework and career progression. I'm also heavily involved in the recruitment process.

### ‚úàÔ∏è &nbsp;[Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.net)

<div class="cv-role">
    Engineering Manager
</div>

<div class="cv-previous-role">
    Previously Senior Software Engineer and Software Engineer 2
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    April 2017 ‚Äì July 2021
</div>

Team lead for [Backpack](https://backpack.github.io), Skyscanner's design system. My time was roughly 50% hands-on coding and the other half on people management, planning OKRs and enabling the team.

I was heavily involved in [Skyscanner's 2019 rebrand](https://koto.studio/project/skyscanner/), a challenging year-long project affecting dozens of teams across the company.

</p>

As a manager, I mentored many of my direct report's through Skyscanner's promotion process, even helping one of them grow from an intern into a senior engineer.

I drove several initiatives outside of my usual scope, like rewriting and maintaining Skyscanner's front-end recruitment test, simplifying the engineering promotion process, as well as championing and running most aspects of Skyscanner's [talent directory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skyscanner_skyscanner-talent-directory-activity-6698944542705496064-5gRn).

### üì±&nbsp;Indie iOS Developer

<div class="cv-date">
    April 2020 - Present
</div>

In my spare time I'm a fan of running, cycling and swimming, which is why I built [Personal Best](https://getpersonalbest.com), a workout tracking app for iPhone built with SwiftUI.

It‚Äôs had over 20,000 downloads and holds a 4.8/5 rating on the App Store. It‚Äôs been featured by Apple on the App Store, as well as in [iMore](https://www.imore.com/fitness-companion-personal-best-now-lets-you-share-your-workouts-glorious-technicolor), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today/) and [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/27/ios-14-widget-apps/), amongst other places.

Alongside developing Personal Best, I also blog about app development at [codakuma.com](https://codakuma.com).

### üìà&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ensighten](https://www.ensighten.com)

<div class="cv-role">
    Front-end Developer
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    August 2013 ‚Äì March 2017
</div>

I worked on a range of projects across Ensighten‚Äôs product line. My most notable work was developing Ensighten‚Äôs design system, which honed their disparate, confusing UIs into a single coherent experience that felt like one family of products.

### üñ•Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;[ICUK](https://www.icuk.net)

<div class="cv-role">
    Software Engineer
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    July 2011 ‚Äì August 2013
</div>

This was my first job after university, where I was able to try my hand at many different technologies across ICUK‚Äôs entire stack, before deciding to specialise on front-end for my subsequent roles.
