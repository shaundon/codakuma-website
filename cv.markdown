## About

I'm a front-end developer turned engineering manager ready for new challenges. I advocate for simple, boring solutions that provide value to end users quickly and often, with best-in-class accessibility and usage of platform standards.

I'm looking for partially-remote roles in London (between 1-3 days in the office, the rest working from home) as either a front-end developer or engineering manager.

## Experience

### ‚úàÔ∏è &nbsp;[Skyscanner](https://skyscanner.net)

<div class="cv-role">
    Engineering Manager
</div>

<div class="cv-previous-role">
    Previously Senior Software Engineer and Software Engineer 2
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    April 2017 ‚Äì Present
</div>

I'm the team lead for [Backpack](https://backpack.github.io), Skyscanner's design system. Around half of my time is spent hands-on coding in React and the other half on people management, planning OKRs and generally enabling the team.

In 2019 Skyscanner had a substantial rebrand. It was a year-long project that affected dozens of teams across the company. My team and I were heavily involved in all aspects ‚Äì from updating the design language, devising a means to roll out the new brand seamlessly across all Skyscanner's products with a single button press, through to the infrastructure work across Skyscanner's apps and web stack to put it into practice. The rebrand was a success, completing without a single problem, which is practically unheard of for a time-sensitive project of this scope.

</p>

On the people management side, I care deeply about the wellbeing and careers of my team. I've mentored most of them through Skyscanner's promotion process, even helping one of them grow from an intern into a senior engineer.

Under my own initiative, I've been involved in a number of initiatives outside of my usual scope, like rewriting and maintaining Skyscanner's JavaScript recruitment test, simplifying the engineering promotion process, as well as championing and running most aspects of Skyscanner's [talent directory](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/skyscanner_skyscanner-talent-directory-activity-6698944542705496064-5gRn). 

### üì±&nbsp;Indie iOS Developer

<div class="cv-date">

</div>

In my spare time I‚Äôm an indie iOS developer building [Personal Best](/personal-best), a workout tracking app for iPhone built with SwiftUI.

It‚Äôs had over 20,000 downloads and holds a 4.8/5 rating on the App Store. It‚Äôs been featured in [iMore](https://www.imore.com/fitness-companion-personal-best-now-lets-you-share-your-workouts-glorious-technicolor), [TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2020/09/16/ios-14-widgets-you-can-try-today/) and [9to5Mac](https://9to5mac.com/2020/12/27/ios-14-widget-apps/), amongst other places.

Alongside developing Personal Best, I also blog about app development at [codakuma.com](https://codakuma.com).

### üìà&nbsp;&nbsp;[Ensighten](https://www.ensighten.com)

<div class="cv-role">
    Front-end Developer
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    August 2013 ‚Äì March 2017
</div>

I worked on a range of projects across Ensighten‚Äôs product line. My most notable work was developing and championing Ensighten‚Äôs design system, which honed their disparate, confusing UIs into a single coherent experience that felt like one family of products.

### üñ•Ô∏è&nbsp;&nbsp;[ICUK](https://www.icuk.net)

<div class="cv-role">
    Software Engineer
</div>

<div class="cv-date">
    July 2011 ‚Äì August 2013
</div>

This was my first job after university, where I was able to try my hand at many different technologies across ICUK‚Äôs entire stack, before deciding to specialise on front-end for my subsequent roles.
