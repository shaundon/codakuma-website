## Roadmap

The 1.0 release of Personal Best was quite basic. The vague roadmap is:

### Smaller, quick features to add

* Add wheelchair workouts to 'popular' section if the user uses a wheelchair.
* Custom data types for workouts, for example pace per 100m when swimming.
* Custom home screen icons.
* Show more than just the top three workouts.
* Heart rate information.

### Larger features that may take more time

* Setting goals and coaching users to work towards them.
* Add a 'dashboard' view where users can pin workouts and metrics to see all the time.
* Set the time period to view from.
* Only show types of workout that users have actually done.
* Notifications for new workouts.
