## Tally's privacy policy

Tally doesn't collect any personally-identifiable data.

All your invoices, recipients, and business details are stored locally on your device. Your settings (company name, contact details, payment information) sync via iCloud if you're signed in, but this data is only accessible by you.

Tally does not use any third-party analytics or tracking services.
