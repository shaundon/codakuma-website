Now that I'm doing contract and freelance work I have to make invoices a lot. This takes me a couple of minutes using a Pages template, but the invoices it makes aren't very nice looking (to my eyes, at least).

I could have just spent ten minutes making a nicer Pages template, but like all good programmers I decided to instead invest a significant amount of time into building a bespoke solution.

So – meet [Tally](https://apps.apple.com/app/tally-pdf-invoice-creator/id6758414743) – a simple invoicing app.

I didn't want to distract myself from focusing on [Personal Best](https://getpersonalbest.com) too much, so v1 of Tally has a modest feature set:

* Save your business and payment details
* Add your customers
* Make 'one off' and 'day rate' invoices
* Export invoices as PDFs

Everything automatically syncs over iCloud, and it supports iOS, iPadOS, macOS, and visionOS.

## What's next

I'm going to leave Tally alone now for a few months while I focus on Personal Best, but when I come back to it I'll start evolving it into a fully-fledged billing platform for freelancers. It's easy to imagine places this could go, like:

* Other types of invoice, like hourly rates
* Purchases orders, quote, and credit notes
* Marking invoices as paid, late, etc
* Emailing out invoices automatically, including reminders and late notifications based on your payment terms
* Static links for invoices, so you can send a link to your client for them to pay online
* Web and Android support
* Monetisation – v1 of Tally is free, but if I pursue this properly I'll gate some features behind a paywall
