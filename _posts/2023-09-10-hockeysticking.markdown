At the end of last year I set myself a goal of doubling [Personal Best](https://getpersonalbest.com)â€™s recurring revenue. At the time I felt like this struck a good balance between challenging while still realistically achievable.

Now in September 2023, Personal Bestâ€™s recurring revenue just hit **37x** of where it was at the end of 2022. In other words, I didn't just double my revenue, I doubled it **five times** and then some ðŸ¤¯.

Here's a chart of monthly recurring revenue in 2023 (so far).

Itâ€™s difficult to put into words how great this makes me feel. Iâ€™ve put thousands of hours into Personal Best, and there have certainly been times when it felt like it wasnâ€™t worth the effort I was putting in. I no longer think that.

There are a few things that happened to help me hit this milestone.

## Going full time indie

In June the startup I worked at was going through layoffs and [I volunteered to be made redundant](/the-fear-is-real). Rather than look for a new job right away, I decided to effectively treat Personal Best as a full-time job and work on that. I had (and still do have) loads of ideas for how to improve Personal Best, but I continually struggled to find time to do it. With this change in circumstances, I suddenly had all the time I could wish for.

Iâ€™m fortunate to have a very understanding partner who was supportive of my choice, if a little surprised at first. On the other hand, my mum was furious at me ðŸ™ˆ

Since going full time on Personal Best, Iâ€™ve managed to ship\* a lot of stuff:

- A completely rewritten sharing screen, which lets you turn a workout into an image to share on social media. The previous version was clunky and difficult to use. The new version is much easier to use and makes much nicer-looking images to boot.
- An all-new watchOS app, built from scratch to follow watchOS 10â€™s new design language. The previous version was thrown together in a single evening, whereas the new version was made with care and thoughtfulness.
- A redesigned workout screen, including facts about how your workout compares to tangible milestones.
- A redesigned workouts tab, with daily, monthly and yearly summaries, as well as photos and route maps from your workouts featured front and centre.
- Improvements to the dashboard tab to feature workout imagery.
- iPad support, thanks to iPadOS 17 including Apple Health.
- StandBy support for widgets.
- A new widget that features workout imagery.
- A redesigned paywall screen.

\*Some of it will ship with iOS 17 and watchOS 10

Iâ€™m not done, and more features are coming. Watch this space. Currently I'm rewriting the stats screen entirely to be more intuitive and feature lots more useful data about your workouts.

## New pricing

Personal Best is monetised with a 'Personal Best Pro' tier inside the app that unlocks lots more features over the free version.

Iâ€™ve always struggled with how much to charge for Personal Best Pro, and itâ€™s lead to a lot of introspection about how much my work is worth. From what Iâ€™ve heard from other indie developers this is very common. In particular, in the lead-in to [Callsheet](https://www.caseyliss.com/2023/8/7/callsheet) being released my favourite podcast [ATP](https://atp.fm) had some great discussions in this area. I found them really helpful and I think every indie developer can benefit from their expertise.

After looking at apps from my peers I realised that I was charging too little for Personal Best, so I increased the price. It caused no decrease in uptake, so Iâ€™m comfortable saying it was the right move. I intend to continue experimenting with the price in the future.

Itâ€™s worth noting that I made use of the App Storeâ€™s _â€˜preserve current price for existing subscribersâ€™_ option when increasing prices. I didnâ€™t want to annoy my existing subscribers with a price increase, so anybody who subscribed before the increase will continue to pay the original price.

## Getting featured on the App Store

This is the thing that made the biggest difference by far. One day I checked my active trials on [RevenueCat](https://www.revenuecat.com) to find it was about ten times higher than usual, and growing all the time. I had no idea why this was happening, until the following day where I found out that Personal Best was included in a list on the App Store in the US.

I canâ€™t overstate how much impact this had on Personal Bestâ€™s downloads. Overnight I went from having around 1,000 daily active users to 20 times that. Iâ€™m very grateful to the App Store editors for seeing my hard work and giving it some exposure, and I hope itâ€™s the first of many features.

## What's next

I'm setting myself another goal. I'd like to get Personal Best to $1,000 monthly recurring revenue by the end of 2023. I'm currently 73% of the way there and it would be an amazing way to cap off the year.

As [I've done](https://codakuma.com/im-feeling-22/) in [previous years](https://codakuma.com/2021-in-review/), I'll write a proper end of year summary for how indie life is going, so check back in December to find out how I did.
